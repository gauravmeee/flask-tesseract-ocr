# Image OCR App

## Overview

The Image OCR App is a web application that allows users to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Built with Flask and Tesseract, this app processes uploaded images, detects and extracts text, and displays the results on a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing text.
- **OCR Processing**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to extract text from the uploaded image.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Draws bounding boxes around detected text areas in the image.
- **Result Display**: Shows the extracted text and provides a link to view the processed image with bounding boxes.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Tesseract OCR
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gauravmeee/flask-tesseract-ocr.git
    cd image-ocr-app
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Tesseract OCR:**

    Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the [official Tesseract repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

5. **Install OpenCV:**

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

6. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Click the "Choose File" button to select an image file.
3. After selecting the file, click the "Scan" button to upload the image and process it.
4. The extracted text will be displayed in the textarea, and you can view the processed image with bounding boxes by clicking the provided link.
